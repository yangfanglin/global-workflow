GFS V16.1.0 RELEASE NOTES


PRELUDE

  NOAA awarded Delivery Order 2 (DO-2) of its commercial radio occultation (RO) 
  data purchase to GeoOptics on February 19, 2021.  This purchase covers 1300 
  occultations a day over a six month period with the data flow starting on 
  March 17, 2021.

  The quality of the GeoOptics occultations was examined during Delivery 
  Order 1 (DO-1) in December 2020 and January 2021.  Forecast impact assessment
  was conducted using half resolution parallels in the GFSv16 framework.

  Testing of the DO-2 data is being carried out using a real time full 
  resolution parallel, v161rt1.  It was initially started in mid-February 
  to test reproducibility with the GFSv16 NCO parallel, then adjusted to reduce
  computational footprint.  Data from GeoOptics began to be assimilated as soon 
  as it was available on March 17.  Configuration for the use of the commercial
  data was informed by the results of DO-1 experimentation, with the quality 
  control and observation errors being treated as other RO data with the 
  exception of lowering the upper bound of data.

  This package also addresses several GFS v16 bugzilla tickets.  GFS v16 
  bugzilla tickets #1196 and #1205 are resolved in this package.   The error 
  reported in bugzilla ticket #1206 has been documented to be compiler, not 
  code, specific.  The DA aspect of GFS v16 bugzilla tickets #216, #1198, #1218,
  #1221, and #1222 are also addressed by this package.  None of the DA 
  bugzilla changes alter analysis results.

  GFSv16 introduced a bug where the sign of the layer height (delz) increment 
  was flipped.  The included bugfix reverts the sign as originally intended.  
  This fix was tested in both a low resolution setting and with a full 
  resolution parallel, v16rt2c.  Once v16rt2c was seen as viable, it also 
  began assimilating the GeoOptics data so both changes were tested in one 
  package.

  There are several wave related fixes being included in this update:
  * Including the RW-NH* boundary points which are used in NHC's 
    offline NWPS system were removed from multi_1 to GFSv16, which 
    also requires a minor script bug fix.  
  * Fix the interpolation to the East Pacific wave grid to include 
    all of the American Samoa islands. 
  * Unmask the Gulf of California, Red Sea and Persian Gulf in the 
    global 0p25 interpolated wave output grid. 


CHANGES TO RESOURCES AND FILE SIZES

  Impact of including RW-NHC points is: There should be no impact to the 
  forecast job timing, however the *wave.out_pnt.points* files in the 
  wave/rundata com directories will each increase in size by 6MB. The 
  JGLOBAL_WAVE_POST_BNDPNTBLL and JGLOBAL_WAVE_POST_BNDPNT will now take 
  approximately 20 minutes longer.  The gfswave.tZZz.ibpbull_tar will 
  increase in size to be 78M, gfswave.tZZz.ibpcbull_tar will now be 42M 
  and the gfswave.tZZz.ibp_tar file will now be 11 GB.  

  Impact of East Pacific and global 0p25 wave grid fixes: There are no 
  impacts in terms of resources or file size. 


IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

  The NOAA VLab and both the NOAA-EMC and NCAR organization spaces on GitHub.com 
  are used to manage the GFS.v16.1 code. The SPA(s) handling the GFS.v16.1 
  implementation need to have permissions to clone VLab gerrit repositories and 
  the private NCAR UPP_GTG repository. All NOAA-EMC organization repositories are 
  publicly readable and do not require access permissions.  Please follow the 
  following steps to install the package on WCOSS-Dell:

  1) cd $NWROOTp3

  2) mkdir gfs.v16.1.0

  3) cd gfs.v16.1.0

  4) git clone -b EMC-v16.1.0  https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/global-workflow.git .

  5) cd sorc

  6) ./checkout.sh -o
     * This script extracts the following GFS components:
         MODEL     tag GFS.v16.0.16                  Jun.Wang@noaa.gov
         GSI       tag gfsda.v16.1.0                 Russ.Treadon@noaa.gov
         GLDAS     tag gldas_gfsv16_release.v1.12.0  Helin.Wei@noaa.gov
         UFS_UTILS tag ops-gfsv16.0.0                George.Gayno@noaa.gov
         POST      tag upp_gfsv16_release.v1.1.3     Wen.Meng@noaa.gov
         WAFS      tag gfs_wafs.v6.0.21              Yali.Mao@noaa.gov

  7) ./build_all.sh
     * This script compiles all GFS components. Runtime output from the build for 
       each package is written to log files in directory logs. To build an 
       individual program, for instance, gsi, use build_gsi.sh.
